# Creating and Submitting Your Application

This guide explains the process of creating your application, deploying it, and submitting it to Genuka for validation and approval.  

---

## 1. Overview

Before your integration can go live, you need to:

1. Build your application (backend and/or frontend).
2. Configure your webhooks and callback URLs.
3. Deploy it to a publicly accessible server.
4. Submit the application details to Genuka for review and approval.

Once approved, your application will be allowed to interact with the Genuka API in production.

---

## 2. Application Requirements

When creating an application, make sure it follows these guidelines:

- **Publicly Accessible**: Your app must be hosted on a secure (HTTPS) server accessible over the internet.
- **Stable Environment**: Avoid using temporary services; ensure uptime and reliability.
- **Webhooks Support**: If your integration requires receiving real-time notifications (e.g., order updates, payments), expose valid webhook endpoints.
- **Data Security**: Handle all credentials (API keys, access tokens) securely.

---

## 3. Steps to Create an Application

### Step 1: Develop Your Application
- Use your preferred technology stack (Node.js, PHP, Python, Java, etc.).
- Integrate with the **Genuka API** following the authentication and endpoint documentation.
- Implement the required business logic (e.g., syncing products, processing orders, handling events).

### Step 2: Prepare Webhooks (Optional but Recommended)
If your application must react to Genuka events (like order created, order updated, payment status changed):

- Implement endpoints such as:
  - `POST https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/genuka/order`
  - `POST https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/genuka/payment`

- Ensure these endpoints:
  - Accept `POST` requests with JSON payloads.
  - Respond quickly with `200 OK`.
  - Validate signatures (if required for security).

### Step 3: Deploy Your Application
- Deploy your application on a secure production server.
- Ensure it uses **HTTPS** (TLS/SSL).
- Verify that all routes and webhook URLs are functional and reachable.

### Step 4: Gather Application Information
Before submission, prepare the following details:

- **Application Name**: Human-readable name of your integration.
- **Application Description**: Brief explanation of what your app does.
- **Public URL**: Main link where Genuka team can view your app (if frontend).
- **Webhook URLs**: List of endpoints your app exposes (if any).
- **Contact Information**: Developer/company contact email.

## 4. Submitting to Genuka

Once your app is ready:

1. Log in to your Genuka developer dashboard (or contact the integrations team).
2. Navigate to **App Submission**.
3. Provide the following details:
   - Application name
   - Public deployment link
   - Webhook URLs
   - Technical documentation (if available)
   - Contact information
4. Submit for **review and validation**.

---

## 5. Validation Process

- **Technical Review**: The Genuka team verifies that your endpoints are reachable and your app correctly integrates with the API.
- **Security Review**: Basic checks to ensure no sensitive data leaks or insecure endpoints.
- **Approval/Feedback**: 
  - If approved → You receive confirmation, and your app is whitelisted for production access.
  - If rejected → Feedback will be shared, and you can re-submit after corrections.

---

## 6. After Approval

Once approved:

- You can start using your **production API keys**.
- Your app will officially be recognized as a validated Genuka integration.
- You will be notified of future updates or changes affecting integrations.
